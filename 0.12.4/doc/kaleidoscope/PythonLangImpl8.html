<h2>8.1. Tutorial Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#tutorial-conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to the the final chapter of the &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html">Implementing a language with LLVM</a>&#8221; tutorial.
In the course of this tutorial, we have grown our little Kaleidoscope language
from being a useless toy, to being a semi-interesting (but probably still useless)
toy. :)</p>
<p>It is interesting to see how far we&#8217;ve come, and how little code it has taken.
We built the entire lexer, parser, AST, code generator, and an interactive run-loop
(with a JIT!) by-hand in under 540 lines of (non-comment/non-blank) code.</p>
<p>Our little language supports a couple of interesting features: it supports user
defined binary and unary operators, it uses JIT compilation for immediate evaluation,
and it supports a few control flow constructs with SSA construction.</p>
<p>Part of the idea of this tutorial was to show you how easy and fun it can be to
define, build, and play with languages. Building a compiler need not be a scary
or mystical process! Now that you&#8217;ve seen some of the basics, I strongly encourage
you to take the code and hack on it. For example, try adding:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>*global variables*</strong> - While global variables have questional value in modern
software engineering, they are often useful when putting together quick
little hacks like the Kaleidoscope compiler itself. Fortunately, our
current setup makes it very easy to add global variables: just have value
lookup check to see if an unresolved variable is in the global variable
symbol table before rejecting it. To create a new global variable, make
an instance of the LLVM GlobalVariable class.</li>
<li><strong>*typed variables*</strong> - Kaleidoscope currently only supports variables of type
double. This gives the language a very nice elegance, because only supporting
one type means that you never have to specify types. Different languages have
different ways of handling this. The easiest way is to require the user to
specify types for every variable definition, and record the type of the variable
in the symbol table along with its Value*.</li>
<li><strong>*arrays, structs, vectors, etc*</strong> - Once you add types, you can
start extending the type system in all sorts of
interesting ways. Simple arrays are very easy and are quite useful
for many different applications. Adding them is mostly an
exercise in learning how the LLVM <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_getelementptr">getelementptr</a> instruction works:
it is so nifty/unconventional, it <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/GetElementPtr.html">has its own FAQ!</a> If you add
support for recursive types (e.g. linked lists), make sure to
read the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#TypeResolve">section in the LLVM Programmer&#8217;s Manual</a> that describes
how to construct them.</li>
<li><strong>*standard runtime*</strong> - Our current language allows the user to
access arbitrary external functions, and we use it for things like &#8220;putchard&#8221;.
As you extend the language to add higher-level constructs, often these
constructs make the most sense if they are lowered to calls into a
language-supplied runtime. For example, if you add hash tables to the
language, it would probably make sense to add the routines to a runtime,
instead of inlining them all the way.</li>
<li><strong>*memory management*</strong> - Currently we can only access the stack in Kaleidoscope.
It would also be useful to be able to allocate heap memory, either with calls
to the standard libc malloc/free interface or with a garbage collector.
If you would like to use garbage collection, note that LLVM fully supports
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/GarbageCollection.html">Accurate Garbage Collection</a>
including algorithms that move objects and need to scan/update the stack.</li>
<li><strong>*debugger support*</strong> - LLVM supports generation of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html">DWARF Debug info</a> which
is understood by common debuggers like GDB. Adding support for debug info is
fairly straightforward. The best way to understand it is to compile some C/C++
code with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">llvm-gcc</span> <span class="pre">-g</span> <span class="pre">-O0</span></tt> and taking a look at what it produces.</li>
<li><strong>*exception handling support*</strong> - LLVM supports generation of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/ExceptionHandling.html">zero cost exceptions</a> which interoperate
with code compiled in other languages. You could also generate code by
implicitly making every function return an error value and checking it.
You could also make explicit use of setjmp/longjmp. There are many different
ways to go here.</li>
<li><strong>*object orientation, generics, database access, complex numbers, geometric
programming, ...*</strong> - Really, there is no end of crazy features that you can
add to the language.</li>
<li><strong>*unusual domains*</strong> - We&#8217;ve been talking about applying LLVM to a domain that
many people are interested in: building a compiler for a specific language.
However, there are many other domains that can use compiler technology that are
not typically considered. For example, LLVM has been used to implement OpenGL
graphics acceleration, translate C++ code to ActionScript, and many other cute
and clever things. Maybe you will be the first to JIT compile a regular expression
interpreter into native code with LLVM?</li>
<li><strong>*Have fun*</strong> - try doing something crazy and unusual. Building a language like
everyone else always has, is much less fun than trying something a little crazy or
off the wall and seeing how it turns out. If you get stuck or want to talk about it,
feel free to email the <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">llvmdev mailing list</a>: it has lots of people who are
interested in languages and are often willing to help out.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Before we end this tutorial, I want to talk about some &#8220;tips and tricks&#8221; for
generating LLVM IR. These are some of the more subtle things that may not be obvious,
but are very useful if you want to take advantage of LLVM&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="properties-of-the-llvm-ir">
<h2>8.2. Properties of the LLVM IR<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of-the-llvm-ir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have a couple common questions about code in the LLVM IR form - let&#8217;s
just get these out of the way right now, shall we?</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="target-independence">
<h3>8.2.1. Target Independence<a class="headerlink" href="#target-independence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Kaleidoscope is an example of a &#8220;portable language&#8221;: any program
written in Kaleidoscope will work the same way on any target that it
runs on. Many other languages have this property, e.g. LISP, Java, Haskell,
Javascript, Python, etc. (note that while these languages are portable,
not all their libraries are).</p>
<p>One nice aspect of LLVM is that it is often capable of preserving target
independence in the IR: you can take the LLVM IR for a Kaleidoscope-compiled
program and run it on any target that LLVM supports, even emitting C code and
compiling that on targets that LLVM doesn&#8217;t support natively.
You can trivially tell that the Kaleidoscope compiler generates target-
independent code because it never queries for any target-specific
information when generating code.</p>
<p>The fact that LLVM provides a compact, target-independent,
representation for code gets a lot of people excited. Unfortunately,
these people are usually thinking about C or a language from the
C family when they are asking questions about language portability.
I say &#8220;unfortunately&#8221;, because there is really no way to make (fully general) C
code portable, other than shipping the source code around (and of course, C
source code is not actually portable in general either - ever port a really old
application from 32- to 64-bits?).</p>
<p>The problem with C (again, in its full generality) is that it is heavily
laden with target specific assumptions. As one simple example, the
preprocessor often destructively removes target-independence from the code
when it processes the input text:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>#ifdef __i386__
  int X = 1;
#else
  int X = 42;
#endif</pre>
</div>
<p>While it is possible to engineer more and more complex solutions to problems like
this, it cannot be solved in full generality in a way that is better than
shipping the actual source code.</p>
<p>That said, there are interesting subsets of C that can be made portable.
If you are willing to fix primitive types to a fixed size (say int = 32-bits, and
long = 64-bits), don&#8217;t care about ABI compatibility with existing binaries, and
are willing to give up some other minor features, you can have portable code.
This can make sense for specialized domains such as an in-kernel language.</p>

<div class="section" id="safety-guarantees">
<h3>8.2.2. Safety Guarantees<a class="headerlink" href="#safety-guarantees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many of the languages above are also &#8220;safe&#8221; languages: it is
impossible for a program written in Java to corrupt its address space and
crash the process (assuming the JVM has no bugs). Safety is an
interesting property that requires a combination of language design,
runtime support, and often operating system support.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible to implement a safe language in LLVM, but LLVM
IR does not itself guarantee safety. The LLVM IR allows unsafe pointer casts,
use after free bugs, buffer over-runs, and a variety of other problems. Safety
needs to be implemented as a layer on top of LLVM and, conveniently, several groups
have investigated this. Ask on the <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">llvmdev mailing list</a> if you are interested
in more details.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="language-specific-optimizations">
<h3>8.2.3. Language-Specific Optimizations<a class="headerlink" href="#language-specific-optimizations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One thing about LLVM that turns off many people is that it does not solve all
the world&#8217;s problems in one system (sorry &#8216;world hunger&#8217;, someone else will
have to solve you some other day). One specific complaint is that people perceive
LLVM as being incapable of performing high-level language-specific optimization:
LLVM &#8220;loses too much information&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is really not the place to give you a full and unified
version of &#8220;Chris Lattner&#8217;s theory of compiler design&#8221;. Instead,
I&#8217;ll make a few observations:</p>
<p>First, you&#8217;re right that LLVM does lose information.
For example, as of this writing, there is no way to
distinguish in the LLVM IR whether an SSA-value came
from a C &#8220;int&#8221; or a C &#8220;long&#8221; on an ILP32 machine
(other than debug info). Both get compiled down to an &#8216;i32&#8217;
value and the information about what it came from is lost.
The more general issue here, is that the LLVM type system
uses &#8220;structural equivalence&#8221; instead of &#8220;name equivalence&#8221;.
Another place this surprises people is if you have two types
in a high-level language that have the same structure (e.g.
two different structs that have a single int field):
these types will compile down into a single LLVM type and it
will be impossible to tell what it came from.</p>
<p>Second, while LLVM does lose information, LLVM is not a
fixed target: we continue to enhance and improve it in many
different ways. In addition to adding new features (LLVM did not
always support exceptions or debug info), we also extend the IR to
capture important information for optimization (e.g. whether an argument
is sign or zero extended, information about pointers aliasing, etc). Many
of the enhancements are user-driven: people want LLVM to include some specific
feature, so they go ahead and extend it.</p>
<p>Third, it is possible and easy to add language-specific optimizations,
and you have a number of choices in how to do it. As one trivial example,
it is easy to add language-specific optimization passes that &#8220;know&#8221; things
about code compiled for a language. In the case of the C family, there is an
optimization pass that &#8220;knows&#8221; about the standard C library functions. If you
call &#8220;exit(0)&#8221; in main(), it knows that it is safe to optimize that into &#8220;return
0;&#8221; because C specifies what the &#8216;exit&#8217; function does.</p>
<p>In addition to simple library knowledge, it is possible to embed a
variety of other language-specific information into the LLVM IR. If
you have a specific need and run into a wall, please bring the topic
up on the llvmdev list. At the very worst, you can always treat LLVM as
if it were a &#8220;dumb code generator&#8221; and implement the high-level optimizations
you desire in your front-end, on the language-specific AST.</p>

<h2>8.3. Tips and Tricks<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-and-tricks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is a variety of useful tips and tricks that you come to
know after working on/with LLVM that aren&#8217;t obvious at first glance.
Instead of letting everyone rediscover them, this section talks about
some of these issues.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="implementing-portable-offsetof-sizeof">
<h3>8.3.1. Implementing portable offsetof/sizeof<a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-portable-offsetof-sizeof" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One interesting thing that comes up, if you are trying to keep the
code generated by your compiler &#8220;target independent&#8221;, is that you often
need to know the size of some LLVM type or the offset of some field in an
llvm structure. For example, you might need to pass the size of a type into
a function that allocates memory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this can vary widely across targets: for example the width
of a pointer is trivially target-specific. However, there is a <a class="reference external" href="http://nondot.org/sabre/LLVMNotes/SizeOf-OffsetOf-VariableSizedStructs.txt">clever way
to use the getelementptr instruction</a> that
allows you to compute this in a portable way.</p>

<div class="section" id="garbage-collected-stack-frames">
<h3>8.3.2. Garbage Collected Stack Frames<a class="headerlink" href="#garbage-collected-stack-frames" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some languages want to explicitly manage their stack frames, often
so that they are garbage collected or to allow easy implementation
of closures. There are often better ways to implement these features
than explicit stack frames, but <a class="reference external" href="http://nondot.org/sabre/LLVMNotes/ExplicitlyManagedStackFrames.txt">LLVM does support them</a>, if you want.
It requires your front-end to convert the code into <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation Passing
Style</a>
and the use of tail calls (which LLVM also supports).</p>
